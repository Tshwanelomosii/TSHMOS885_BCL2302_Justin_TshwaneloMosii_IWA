// Two objects are then created, example1 and example2, each with an internal property containing three properties a, b, and c. They also have add, multiply, and calculate properties. The calculate property is assigned the internal function, which will be called when the calculate property is invoked.

// The last two lines of code call the calculate method on example1 and example2 and log the results to the console. The calculate method will execute the internal function in the context of the object on which it was called, using the this keyword to refer to that object. The expected output is 48 for example1 and 12 for example2, which are the results of the calculations performed by the internal function on each object's properties.
